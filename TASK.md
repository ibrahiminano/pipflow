## 🔍 Discovered During Work

### Technical Discoveries
- Need to create PLANNING.md and TASK.md files ✅
- Folder structure needs to be populated with actual files
- MetaAPI doesn't have native iOS SDK - must use REST API
- TradingView iOS SDK requires license

### Dependencies to Add
- Alamofire or URLSession for networking
- Combine for reactive programming
- KeychainAccess for secure storage
- Charts framework as TradingView alternative

### Architecture Decisions
- Use MVVM with Combine
- Repository pattern for data access
- Coordinator pattern for navigation
- Factory pattern for dependency injection

## 📝 Notes

### Priority Order
1. Project setup and configuration
2. Authentication system
3. Core networking services
4. Basic UI structure
5. MetaAPI integration
6. Trading features
7. AI integration
8. Social features

### Blockers
- MetaAPI token needed for testing
- Supabase project setup required
- TradingView license or alternative charting solution
- AI API keys (Claude/OpenAI)

### Next Actions
1. Complete Xcode project configuration
2. Add Swift Package dependencies
3. Create remaining folder structure files
4. Implement basic app navigation
5. Start authentication implementation
