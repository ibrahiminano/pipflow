## 🔍 Discovered During Work

### Technical Discoveries
- Need to create PLANNING.md and TASK.md files ✅
- Folder structure needs to be populated with actual files
- MetaAPI doesn't have native iOS SDK - must use REST API
- TradingView iOS SDK requires license

### Dependencies to Add
- Alamofire or URLSession for networking
- Combine for reactive programming
- KeychainAccess for secure storage
- Charts framework as TradingView alternative

### Architecture Decisions
- Use MVVM with Combine
- Repository pattern for data access
- Coordinator pattern for navigation
- Factory pattern for dependency injection
